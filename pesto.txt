Ingredients
	2 tbsp. pine nuts, preferably Italian
	1 tsp. kosher salt
	2 garlic cloves, preferably a delicate red-skinned variety, peeled
	2 bunches sweet Italian basil, leaves picked, thick stems removed (2 packed cups
	6-8 tbsp. olive oil, preferably Ligurian
	1⁄4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano
	1⁄4 cup Pecorino Fiore Sardo (Pecorino Sardo)

Instructions
In a large mortar, add the pine nuts, salt, and garlic cloves. Using a large pestle, pound and scrape the ingredients into a very smooth paste, 5–7 minutes. 
Add the basil in small amounts, working it into the mixture after each addition, until all the basil has been added and the mixture is smooth and creamy, 
15–20 minutes. Slowly add the oil while stirring with the pestle until emulsified. Add both cheeses and stir with the pestle to incorporate.
